# 🚀 Real-Time Sales Dashboard | Internship Project Report

## 📌 Introduction
This internship project focuses on building a **real-time, interactive sales dashboard** using **Google Looker Studio**. The dashboard is powered by a dataset from Kaggle, with back-end processing done in **MySQL Workbench** and **Jupyter Notebook**. This project simulates a real-world **Business Intelligence** scenario — analyzing and visualizing sales data to support strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🔍 Apply data cleaning and preprocessing techniques  
- 🧠 Extract meaningful insights using SQL  
- 📊 Build an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio  
- 💾 Upload and document the full project on GitHub  
- 💼 Strengthen practical data analytics & reporting skills  

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning
- Raw sales data imported from **Kaggle**
- Cleaned using **Pandas** in Jupyter Notebook
- Removed irrelevant columns, handled missing values, corrected data types

### 2. SQL for Data Structuring
- Used **MySQL Workbench** to:
  - Join multiple tables
  - Group and filter sales metrics
  - Prepare datasets for visualization

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted in **Jupyter Notebook** using:
  - `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`
  - Trend analysis, KPI tracking, and data visualization (line/bar charts)

### 4. Dashboard Design in Looker Studio
- Built an interactive and clean dashboard with:
  - 📈 Line Graphs – Sales over time  
  - 📊 Bar Charts – Top-selling products, revenue by region  

## 📍 Key Insights & Dashboards
- Peak sales periods by day/month
- Product performance by geography
- Growth comparison over time
- KPIs: Revenue, AOV, Top customers
